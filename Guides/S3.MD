Directory Listing flaw on S3 buckets
S3 allows users to register a domain hosted on S3 (files are saved on the bucket)

How to check if a website is hosted on S3?
If an nslookup shows an A record with an IP address of amazon. then browse the ip and see if it belongs to S3
if so then it hosted on S3

Once it is hosted on S3, it can be reached this way
http://<bucket-name>.s3-website-<region>.amazonaws.com/

Next check of it allows listing of all S3 objects
http://<bucket-name>.s3.amazonaws.com/

Note
this is also a valid address to browse
https://s3.amazonaws.com/<bucket-name>/index.html

Note
Sometimes anonymous access is foribbed however if the permission is set to "any authetnicated aws user"
then you can just enter with your own key+secret
